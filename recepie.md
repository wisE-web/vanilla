Let all the ingredients come to room temperature
Heat the oven to 350 F.
Butter and flour two 9-inch cake pans.

Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix until the dry ingredients are combined.

With the mixer on the lowest speed, add the butter one chunk at a time, and blend until the mixture forms a grainy consistency, between 30 seconds and 1 minute. Scrape down the bowl and paddle with a rubber spatula. 

Add vanilla and, with the mixer on low, slowly pour in the milk. Stop and scrape, and mix for another minute.

Add the first egg, and mix on medium-low until incorporated; add the second egg and do the same. Mix until fluffy, about 30 seconds, then scrape down the bowl.
 
 Pour the batter into the prepared pans and give each one a couple of solid taps on the countertop to release any air bubbles. Transfer pans to the oven.

 Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean or with a crumb or two attached. (You can start testing at 30 minutes because it's better to check too soon than to over bake.) The tops will be golden brown, the edges will pull away from the sides of the pan, and the cakes will spring back when you touch them.

 Cool the cakes on a wire rack for 10 minutes, then loosen the edges by running a knife along the sides of the pan; turn the cakes out onto the racks and cool for at least 1 hour before frosting.â€‹
